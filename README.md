# case-8-nodejs-react
Decription
Welcome to my cinema-app, in order to start this application please follow these steps. I will explain it so even my mom could do it!

Prerequisites
In this app I use node.js, express, nodemon and react, some of these we will need to install to make this work.

PLEASE NOTICE!
This app doesn't have a working front page at the moment!

Installation
Backend:
1. We start with getting the server going. we do that by opening a terminal, either by clicking terminal in the bar at the top (could be at the three dots), press new terminal, or you could use the quick command (ctrl, shift and รถ at tha same time). Now we have a terminal at the bottom of this screen and we will type in it. 
2. The server is in the folder named backend so we type " cd backend " (without "")and enter, to reach the right folder. 
3. In here we type " npm install " and enter to install required dependencies. 
4. Now we enter " npm install express " to get express on our server to make it work.
5. Enter " npm install nodemon --save-dev " to get the tool that helps our server restart smoothly.
6. Lastly we get the server going by entering " npm run dev ".
The server is running but we leave that terminal open!

Frontend:
1. Let's open another terminal by splitting the terminal screen, we do that either by pressing on terminal on the top bar again and chose split screen or we use the quick command ( ctrl, shift and 5). Now we have two terminals, we will leave the backend terminal to the left alone, press on the right one instead.
2. We need to direct us to the right folder so we enter " cd frontend ".
3. Lets install react dependencies by typing " npm install " and enter.
4. To get frontend started enter " npm start " and you will get a new page opening in your browser.
Feel free to explore the app!
